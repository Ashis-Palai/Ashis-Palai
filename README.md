Hi, I’m @Ashis-Palai — Focused on Cloud Security, Threat Hunting, and Cloud Threat Investigation.
🧠 I work on AI-assisted security workflows that help investigate and correlate attacker behavior across cloud control plane, network, and workload telemetry, using MITRE ATT&CK to reconstruct end-to-end attack chains beyond traditional rule-based detections.

🎓 Cloud-native security monitoring, detection engineering, synthetic attack simulation, and investigation tooling, with an emphasis on understanding how adversaries operate in AWS ,Azure and GCP environments.

🤝 Always Open to collaborating on cloud security, threat hunting, and detection research projects where AI can truly enhance outcomes and create scalable solutions.
